# CNN and Hyperparameter Tuning Practice

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my practice and experimentation with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and hyperparameter tuning. The project consists of multiple Jupyter Notebook files, each addressing different aspects of CNNs, from building basic architectures to fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:**
  - `01_CNN_Basics.ipynb`: Introduction to CNNs and building a simple architecture.
  - `02_Image_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Exploring image preprocessing techniques for CNNs.
  - `03_Hyperparameter_Tuning.ipynb`: Hands-on practice with hyperparameter tuning.
  - *Add more notebooks as needed.*

- **Datasets:**
  - Include any relevant datasets used in the notebooks.

- **Results:**
  - Document and share notable results, model performance metrics, and visualizations.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **CNN Practice:**
   - Gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing CNN architectures.
   - Understand the fundamentals of convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected layers.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Explore techniques for tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
   - Experiment with tools like Grid Search or Random Search for finding optimal configurations.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the notebooks in sequential order or jump to specific topics based on your interest. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and includes explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to aid your understanding.

## Contributions

Contributions, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome! If you have insights, improvements, or additional resources related to CNNs and hyperparameter tuning, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
